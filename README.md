# Scan-Up-App
To those who are reading this, I made this app when I was in my first year of high school when I knew nothing about naming conventions. I know now to not name files, classes, variables, and other elements names such as the ones I used. And of course, the lack of documentation and comments is terrible and I have since improved on documentating all of my code. Also as not aware of how to properly connect the client side of the app to the server side but have since learned. I hope you have a good laugh at my terrible file names and I have learned from my mistakes and my more recent projects are a little more up to standard. Thank you.
